Bluebot is a Project Management tool that helps you manage project flows that are **repetitive** but **deterministic**. It extends[ **GitHub projects**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) by providing a way to automate task creation and tracking based on simple pre-defined structures provided by the user in **Markdown**.

## Motivation

GitHub Projects provides a robust system to managing projects with tools not dissimilar to industry standards like [Jira by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
