Bluebot is a Project Management tool that helps you manage project flows that are **repetitive** but **deterministic**. It extends[ **GitHub projects**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) by providing a way to automate task creation and tracking based on simple pre-defined structures provided by the user in **Markdown**.

## Motivation

GitHub Projects provides a robust system to managing projects with tools not dissimilar to industry standards like [Jira by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). The executive and project teams at [Carleton Blueprint](https://cublueprint.org) use GitHub Projects as our main project management tool.
 
In order to provide **transparency** and a clear view of the project's progress, the VP Projects maintains updated milestones, issues, and tasks relating to each project.

This process is acceptable for a *small number of projects*, but as the number of projects increases, the VP Projects must ^^manually^^ create and update tasks, issues, and milestones for each project, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution

Given that the execution flow of each project is **repetitive** and **deterministic**, we can automate the creation and tracking of tasks, issues, and milestones based on simple pre-defined structures provided by the user in [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

With this approach, you can still make use of the plethora of features provided by GitHub Projects by default, while also enjoying the benefits of automation, managed by Bluebot.

!!! note "A Subtle Note"
    - Bluebot is **==not==** a *replacement* for GitHub Projects, but rather an extension that provides automation capabilities to GitHub Projects. 
    - For all intents and purposes, you should still leverage as many features as possible from stock GitHub Projects, including the use of labels, assignees, project boards, and comment threads to track statuses and updates on tasks.
